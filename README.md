## Problem Statement

Issue 1: Computer Science Development Challenges

There may have been a major issue as a result of Malaysian colleges' inadequate offering of computer science electives. Countries having a strong foundation in computer science and technology are more  prosper on the international scene in this fast-paced technological era. More exposure to computer science is necessary for the pupils to understand its advantages. Students who are not introduced to computer science early enough may not have it, which might hinder its economic development. Furthermore, a deficiency in computer science education might have an effect on several industries.

Issue 2:Teacher Training and Capacity

The second concern relates to the significance of the teacher preparation program's  goal of teaching computer science to the pupils. For a teacher to teach computer science , implementing effective computer science and navigating the technology-driven learning environment are crucial. Before beginning to educate pupils, the teacher may require ongoing professional development and training.These days, the number of teachers with computer science competence who are qualified to instruct secondary school pupils is far too few.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, and powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
